abstract: Despite a wealth of studies exploring the nexus between climate change and civil conflict, the field is rife with null findings, which should raise questions about the efficacy of traditional research methods and variables. I propose that the high incidence of null findings may stem from an imprecise alignment between climate measurements and their actual impact on agrarian communities, especially in the developing world, where agriculture serves as a cornerstone for employment and survival. This study bridges this gap by zeroing in on the changes to the land's ``carrying capacity," the maximum sustainable agricultural output the land can support. I propose researchers use Albedo as a key proxy for capturing these changes to land, particularly desertification. The study also challenges the notion that rainfall is always beneficial and challenges whether rainfall, a weather variable, should be used to measure climate change. I posit that as the carrying capacity of an area declines, especially in rural communities, competition for dwindling resources intensifies, thereby increasing the risk of conflict. Machine learning and regression models find a positive relationship between Albedo changes and conflict onset. The findings emphasize the need for nuanced environmental metrics in understanding the complex relationship between climate change and civil conflict, offering new avenues for research and policy.

summary: This study suggests that traditional methods of exploring the link between climate change and civil conflict are flawed due to imprecise metrics, and proposes using Albedo as a key indicator for changes in land's "carrying capacity," finding a positive relationship between Albedo changes and conflict onset through machine learning and regression models.
