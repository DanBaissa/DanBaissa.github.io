abstract: The interplay between the military and civilian government can structure politics and determine coup propensity. The civil-military relations literature focuses on the military part of this relationship, finding that certain types of militaries are prone to interfere in civilian governance. We argue that the civilian state and political parties play a determinative role in shaping military strategy. Through Cox Proportional Hazards models, we show that state and party strength predict the likelihood of a military coup better than established indicators of military strength. These findings underline the importance of theorizing about the civil part of civil-military relations by incorporating insights from studies on institutions.
