abstract: Climate change has far-reaching implications, with desertification being a notable consequence. This study investigates the complex relationship between desertification and human migration within the context of Syria, where a severe drought has been linked to the civil war. Utilizing albedo as a proxy for desertification and night lights for population movement, we conducted a multi-model regression analysis, including OLS, Spatially Lagged, Spatial Error, and M-Estimator. Our findings reveal a significant correlation between drought and urban migration, with an estimated one million individuals migrating to cities. The results highlight the importance of understanding environmental migration dynamics and offer valuable insights for policymakers addressing climate change adaptation and sustainable land use. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on climate-driven migration and provides a methodological framework for future studies.
