                        <p>Although numerous studies have examined the link between climate change and civil conflict, many yield null results, possibly due to misaligned climate measurements and their real impact on agrarian communities. This study suggests using Albedo as a proxy for land's carrying capacity changes and finds a positive relationship between Albedo changes and conflict onset, highlighting the importance of nuanced environmental metrics for understanding this complex relationship.</p>
